**Dataset Description**<br>
The Global Superstore Dataset contains sales transaction data from a fictional superstore with operations worldwide. The dataset includes:<br>

**1)Order Information:** Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Ship Mode<br>
**2)Customer Details:** Customer ID, Name, Segment, City, State, Country, Postal Code<br>
**3)Product Information:** Product ID, Category, Sub-Category, Product Name<br>
**4)Sales Metrics:** Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit, Shipping Cost<br>
**5)Geographical Data:** Market, Region<br>

**Data Source**<br>
The dataset is commonly used for educational purposes and is available from multiple online resources. It is structured with 24 columns and over 50,000 rows.<br>

**Analysis Objectives**<br>

The main objectives of this analysis are:<br>
**1)Sales Performance:** Understand sales trends across different markets, regions, and periods.<br>
**2)Customer Segmentation:** Identify key customer segments and their purchasing behaviors.<br>
**3)Product Analysis:** Assess the performance of different product categories and sub-categories.<br>
**4)Shipping Analysis:** Evaluate shipping modes and costs in relation to delivery times and customer satisfaction.<br>
**5)Profitability:** Determine the profitability across different segments and categories.<br>

**Methodology** <br>

**1)Data Cleaning:** Removal of duplicates, handling missing values, and correcting data types.<br>
**2)Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Use of descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand the data.<br>
**3)Segmentation and Clustering:** Grouping customers and products to identify patterns.<br>
**4)Trend Analysis:** Analyzing sales and profit trends over time and across regions.<br>
**5)Geospatial Analysis:** Mapping sales performance by geography.<br>

**Key Findings** <br>

**1)Top Performing Regions:** Certain regions consistently outperform others in sales and profit margins.<br
**2)High-Value Customers:** A small segment of customers contributes disproportionately to total sales.<br>
**3)Product Categories:** Technology products generate the highest sales, but furniture has the highest profit margins.<br>
**4)Shipping Modes:** The fastest shipping modes are often not the most profitable, highlighting potential inefficiencies.<br>
